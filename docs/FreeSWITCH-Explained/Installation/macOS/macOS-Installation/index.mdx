* 3 [Homebrew Installation](#homebrew-installation)
* 4 [macOS FreeSWITCH™ Installer (macFI)](#macos-freeswitch-installer-macfi)
* 5 [Manual Installation](#manual-installation)

# Installation Methods

FreeSWITCH™ installation on macOS is performed using one of these methods:

* [Homebrew](#homebrew-installation), the fastest method to get started. **Apple Silicon version available.**
* The [macFI installer utility](#macos-freeswitch-installer-macfi), identical to manual but faster and with installation logs.
* [Manually](#manual-installation), if you want to build from source and know every detail of the installation.

# Build and Testing Status

This status does _not apply_ to the Homebrew version. Testing is performed on Intel Macs with macOS and the latest Apple Command Line Tools installed into new volumes.

# Homebrew Installation

This is the **easiest and fastest way to install FreeSWITCH on macOS.** To perform a Homebrew installation use the [macOS Homebrew Installation](./macOS-Homebrew-Installation_72253508.mdx#about) instructions.

**Advantages**

* Easiest method to install FreeSWITCH™.
* **Apple Silicon and Intel versions available**.
* Support for the last three macOS versions.
* Utilizes the least disk space.

**Disadvantages**

* Is provided as a runtime only version, so building optional modules from source is difficult but not usually required.
* Only provides the current production version.
* Information on this wiki is limited to testing results since the Homebrew version is maintained independently from this wiki.

# macOS FreeSWITCH™ Installer (macFI)

The macOS FreeSWITCH™ Installer **_performs identical functions as a [manual installation](./macOS-Manual-Installation_13174557.mdx#about)_** with additions such as logging.

The macOS FreeSWITCH™ Installer automates all of the manual steps, providing much simpler and faster installation. The macFI information and download is located at [macOS macFI Installation](./macOS-macFI-Installation_1966731.mdx#about).  

**Advantages**

* The same as manual installation below.
* Much faster than manual installation performing identical steps.
* Auto renaming existing FreeSWITCH™ directories before installation to preserve them.
* Creation of logs for each installation step.

**Disadvantages**

* The same as manual installation below, except faster.

# Manual Installation

A manual installation requires use of macOS Terminal to enter commands, setup directories, install prerequisites and FreeSWITCH™. To perform a manual installation use the [macOS Manual Installation](./macOS-Manual-Installation_13174557.mdx#about) instructions.

**Advantages**

* Provides access to current release, master (next release), and updated current FreeSWITCH versions.
* Building from source provides adding optional modules easily.
* Testing is performed for this wiki so information is extensive.

**Disadvantages**

* Longest method to install FreeSWITCH™.
* Utilizes more disk space than the Homebrew version.
* **No Apple Silicon testing for now**.
