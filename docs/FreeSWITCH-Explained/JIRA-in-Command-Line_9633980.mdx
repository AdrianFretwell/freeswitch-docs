* 2 [Reporting bugs to JIRA](#reporting-bugs-to-jira)
* 3 [Fixing bugs](#fixing-bugs)

## Getting the Scripts

Both script are under support-d/utils in FreeSWITCHâ„¢ source tree. If you don't want to clone the repository in your machine, here's the directly link for them:

filebug.pl: <https://freeswitch.org/stash/projects/FS/repos/freeswitch/browse/support-d/utils/filebug.pl>

fixbug.pl: <https://freeswitch.org/stash/projects/FS/repos/freeswitch/browse/support-d/utils/fixbug.pl>

## Reporting bugs to JIRA

With filebug.pl you can submit new issues from your command line interface. There's a few dependencies that we need to install to make it properly work.

You'll need CPAN to install those deps, more information [here](http://www.cpan.org/).

**Install Perl deps**

```bash
cpan install Getopt::Long JIRA::REST Mozilla::CA 
```

(depending on your platform you'll need to run with sudo). 

The script has a few options that can be used, if none are provided it'll open your editor (Emacs or Vi) and ask for required data.

**Creating an Issue**

```bash
./filebug.pl -versions="1.6"
User: italorossi
Password:
```

After typing your password, your editor will be opened with the following:

```xml
; Enter the description lines beginning with a ; will be ignored.
Type your description here then save and quit.
```

Then it'll ask for the summary:

```xml
./filebug.pl
Password:
User: italorossi
Password:
Summary: Testing filebug.pl, ignore me.
Issue Posted: FS-8096%

Issue Posted: FS-8096 .
