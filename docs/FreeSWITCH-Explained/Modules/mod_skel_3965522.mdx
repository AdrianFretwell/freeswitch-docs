## About

## mod_skel provides a template for [new modules](../Community/Contributing-Code/Creating-New-Modules/index.mdx#about). It has the basic components to allow a new module to be written, with no code that does anything useful beyond loading the module into FreeSWITCH

mod\_skel is part of the FreeSWITCH source tree. To get it just clone FreeSWITCH as normal.
