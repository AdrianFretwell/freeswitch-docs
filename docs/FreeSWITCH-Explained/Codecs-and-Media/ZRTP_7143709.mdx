## Making FreeSWITCH History

On Wed, May 20, 2009, bkw\_ announced ZRTP support in FreeSWITCH core. ZRTP is SRTP based, but instead of using SIP to exchange keys, it exchanges keys within the media stream itself making it more secure. It does not require [PKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key%5Finfrastructure). With integrated ZRTP support, FreeSWITCH automatically negotiates secure connections with endpoints that support the protocol. Currently, ZRTP is integrated into a few softphones, and is also available as a intermediary client application that intercepts your softphone's media and negotiates key exchange with FreeSWITCH (or any other ZRTP enabled endpoint). In our case, we will use the ZRTP SDK to build the supporting library for FreeSWITCH.

## Getting Started

In order to enable ZRTP on FreeSWITCH, you need to be on a version newer than 05 Apr 2012\. Versions prior to that will require you to separately obtain the libZRTP SDK.

### Step 1

You will need to execute the following as your normal build process.

git pull
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --enable-zrtp
make
make install

### Step 2

Assuming you have existing configurations, you need to add (or check is there) the following at the end of the settings stanza in your conf/autoload\_configs/switch.conf.xml. For clarification, look at src/freeswitch/conf/autoload\_configs/switch.conf.xml:

&lt;param name="rtp-enable-zrtp" value="true"/>

## 

### Verification

#### Verification with a soft-phone

Enable ZRTP in your dialplan or globally as described below.

At this point you should be able to start your FreeSWITCH with ZRTP active. To test, return to the ZFone site and download the ZFone client app for your platform. After installing and firing it up, start up your favorite softphone (make sure it's supported, X-Lite is) and call your loopback (9996). If the ZFone client lights up green with "Secure Audio," Congratulations - Your FreeSWITCH is ZRTP capable!

#### Verification with FreeSWITCH CLI and Debug

Assuming you're familiar with the FreeSWITCH CLI, you can enable debug output and watch for the following output when the session starts. The important part to look for is "\[ zrtp main\]: Session initialization - DON"

## Enabling And Disabling ZRTP With The 'zrtp_secure_media' Variable

ZRTP can be controlled on a per-channel basis or globally with the **zrtp\_secure\_media** variable. To enable or disable globally use this API syntax:

global_setvar zrtp_secure_media=[true|false]

To enable or disable on a single channel from the dialplan use the set application:

&lt;action application="set" data="zrtp_secure_media=[true|false]"/>

NOTE: Setting the **zrtp\_secure\_media** variable for a channel will override the global settings.

## Enrollment For Trusted Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)

Use the **zrtp\_enrollment** variable to have FreeSWITCH send an enrollment packet for trusted MITM:

&lt;action application="set" data="zrtp_enrollment=true"/>

## ZRTP passthru

When using MITM and you enable **proxy-media** you might experience that the UAs ignore the zrtp-hash. In that case you should enable **inbound-zrtp-passthru**:

&lt;param name="inbound-zrtp-passthru" value="true"/>
