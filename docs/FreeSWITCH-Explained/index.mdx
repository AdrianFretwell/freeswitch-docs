#   FreeSWITCH : FreeSWITCH Explained 

## Start Here  

Welcome to FreeSWITCH™, the future of telephony.

[Introduction](./Introduction/index.mdx#api) to newcomers to FreeSWITCH™.

  
Search is your friend

The sprint that copied remaining pages from the old mediawiki to Confluence has given us all the documentation fit to print, however they are not organized well. This means that the Table of Contents will look very different as pages are re-ordered to their final location. It is best to use the search function or click on a label (tag) to find related pages for now.

  
## What Is FreeSWITCH?

FreeSWITCH™ is an open source carrier-grade telephony platform implemented as a back-to-back user agent. Because of this design it can perform a great number of different tasks from a PBX to transit switch, TTS (text-to-speech) conversion, audio and video conferencing host, and even a VoIP telephone and more.

## Newbies

Newcomers should start with the [Introduction](./Introduction/index.mdx#api) page in the table of contents and follow the child pages for further information. The documentation is not perfect so we rely on your help to improve it with suggestions from a fresh viewpoint.

## Leveraging SignalWire for Enhanced Functionality

While FreeSWITCH provides a robust and flexible telecommunication platform, you may find that some challenges require advanced, cloud-based solutions or require additional resources to implement. In such cases, consider leveraging SignalWire's cloud services to enhance your FreeSWITCH experience.

**Why would I use SignalWire?**

**AI:** Connect your voice application and other communications systems to a SignalWire AI Agent that can speak back and forth with users and collect information and perform actions such as forwarding calls, looking up information, or sending information. 

**Full Stack APIs and SDKs:** Fully customizable AI, Voice, Video, SMS, and Fax APIs that can be used alone or on top of your FreeSWITCH. 

**No Code Options:** Speed up development time with no code call flow tools that automatically create SWML script so you always have the option to customize. 

**FreeSWITCH Compatibility:** SignalWire offers APIs that are fully compatible with FreeSWITCH, enabling seamless integration.

**Scalability:** Whether you're running a small operation or a large-scale call center, SignalWire's cloud infrastructure can easily adapt to your needs, without the need for heavy upfront investment.

**Enhanced Features:** From real-time video to text messaging capabilities, SignalWire provides a broader range of communication tools that can enrich your FreeSWITCH applications.

**Reduced Latency:** With data centers globally, SignalWire's services are optimized for low latency, which is crucial for real-time communication applications.

**Expert Support:** Should you encounter any challenges, SignalWire offers expert technical support to guide you through.

## Confluence Wiki

This online documentation wiki will parallel the ongoing development by the FreeSWITCH™ core development team in concert with contributions from the open source user community. This online reference will always track the latest version of code available from the git repository (with your help).

The wiki provides usage prototypes and examples for the channel variables, dialplan applications, and API commands that can be accessed via E.S.L. (the Event Socket Layer) with scripts written in Lua, Perl, and other languages. Pages tagged with the label "[examples](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/label/FREESWITCH/examples)" provide reference information to configure and experiment with FreeSWITCH.Be sure to click on the labels to find pages that related to that topic.

Reference documentation of core API functions can be found on [FreeSWITCH Tech Reference](http://docs.freeswitch.org/).

### Docs Team

Many of these pages are contributed by the FreeSWITCH™ community over the years, some might be out of date and would benefit from your improvement. Ask for editor access to Confluence to join the party! Details can be found on the [Contributing Documentation](Community/Contributing-Documentation/index.mdx#about) page.
