## record_sample_rate

integer Set the sample rate of the recording.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="record_sample_rate=8000"/>
```

TODO <https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/master/src/mod/applications/mod%5Fdptools/mod%5Fdptools.c> refers to channel variable `record_rate` but that is the entire occurrence in the entire code base; is that an error?
