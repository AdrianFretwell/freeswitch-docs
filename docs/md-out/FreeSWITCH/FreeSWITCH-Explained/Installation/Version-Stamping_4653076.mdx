# FreeSWITCH Versioning  

The template for FreeSWITCHâ„¢ version numbering is:

Major.Minor.PointRelease

## Major Release 

The major version is currently at 1 and should be for the foreseeable future.

## Minor Release  

even = release version

odd = development version, which is the even release number +1  

## Point Release

Incremented as code is committed by the core development team.
