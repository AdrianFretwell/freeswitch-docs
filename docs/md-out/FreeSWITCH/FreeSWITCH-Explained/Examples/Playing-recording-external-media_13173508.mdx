## 1\. CLI examples

### 1.1 Play WAV into a conference

Assuming that a conference named `freeswitch` is configured, and at least one party is connected:

```xml
freeswitch@host> conference freeswitch play /tmp/foo.wav
```

`foo.wav` will have to be 8kz, 16-bit, 1 channel, otherwise the audio will sound distorted because the timing will be wrong. (At least when testing with a Sipura ATA)

### 1.2 Play local MP3 into a conference

To play MP3 files, [mod\_shout](../Modules/mod_shout_3965531.mdx#21-play) needs to be built and loaded.

Assuming that a conference named `freeswitch` is configured, and at least one party is connected:

```xml
freeswitch@host> conference freeswitch play /tmp/foo.mp3
```

MP3 can be encoded at either 8Khz or 44,100khz, and it will sound correct in both cases.

### 1.3 Broadcast WAV into live call

Issue `show channels` at the [console](../Client-and-Developer-Interfaces/1048948.mdx#or), find the UUID for the call you are interested in, and use

```xml
uuid_broadcast <uuid> /path/to/file.wav both
```

## 2\. Python examples

### 2.1 Play remote MP3

To play MP3 files, [mod\_shout](../Modules/mod_shout_3965531.mdx#21-play) needs to be built and loaded.

Create a Python script that calls

```xml
session.playFile("shout://some.server.com/file.mp3")
```

See [mod\_python](../Modules/mod_python_1048940.mdx#eol) for a sample script this can be plugged into.

## 3\. Dialplan examples

```xml
  <extension name="wavs">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^2009$">
      <action application="playback" data="/path/to/your.wav"/>
    </condition>
  </extension>
```
