# About

Use unbind\_meta\_app to unbind a key previously bound with bind\_meta\_app. Takes the key value as its ARG. If no argument (key value) is provided, then ALL keys bound on the channel will be unbound.

# Examples

```xml
<!-- Unbind a particular key - in this case, 7 (dialing *7 will not trigger any app after this is executed). -->
<action application="unbind_meta_app" data="7"/>

<!-- Unbind ALL keys bound on this channel. -->
<action application="unbind_meta_app" data=""/>
```

# Notes

After bind\_meta\_app binds a key on a call leg, that binding will exist for the entire life of the call leg - or until unbind\_meta\_app is used. However, in some instances it may not suffice to perform unbind\_meta\_app on a particular key - you may want to do unbind\_meta\_app for ALL keys (provide no argument):

```xml
<!-- Unbind ALL keys bound on this channel. -->
<action application="unbind_meta_app" data=""/>
```

To explain this note, consider the case of a call leg on which bind\_meta\_app was executed to bind only the digit 7\. Later on in the life of the call, the call leg is sent through an IVR. Before placing the call leg into the IVR, unbind\_meta\_app for key 7 is executed:

```xml
<action application="unbind_meta_app" data="7"/>
```

Although 7 was the only key bound, and now it is unbound, pressing '\*' will still tell the system to listen for meta app digit. So, even though unbind\_meta\_app 7 was executed, pressing '\*' will have no effect in the IVR the call leg is now in. To completely turn off the meta app binding mechanism, do:

```xml
<action application="unbind_meta_app" data=""/>
```

BEFORE placing the call leg into an IVR. Then the IVR can correctly detect '\*', should you use '\*' in your IVR.
