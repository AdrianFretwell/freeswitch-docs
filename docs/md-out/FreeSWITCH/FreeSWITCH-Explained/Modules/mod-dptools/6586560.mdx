# mod_dptools: endless_playback 

 Created by  Lucas Castro, last modified by  livem Chan on 2017.11.08

# About

This application is used to play a file endlessly and the playing **cannot be stopped** externally.

# Usage

```xml
<action application="endless_playback" data="filename"/>
```

# Notes

Call control events, particularly hangup, will terminate endless playback. DTMF detection will not interrupt endless playback.

The [pause](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx#command-2) API command will pause playback generated by this app.

The [uuid\_break](../mod_commands_1966741.mdx#uuid_break) API command will restart playback from the beginning of the file, but will not terminate playback.
